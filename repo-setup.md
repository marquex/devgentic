When adding a new repo we need to make sure that the repo is set up correctly. This includes:

- Cloning the repo locally
- Create the .agentic folder in it
- Create the claude.md file if it doesn't exist
- Install the devgentic claude plugin if it doesn't exist
- Analyze how to install all the dependencies of the repo to be able to run it locally
- From the install dependencies steps, create a e2b template to allow running the repo in a e2b sandbox
